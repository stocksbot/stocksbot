# Stocks Bot
For the completion of CS 192.

Created using [Shalltear boilerplate](https://github.com/lickorice/shalltear). Migrated from Discord.py to Nextcord.

## Installation
To install dependencies of the bot, you may opt to [activate a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) before doing so.

Make sure to open the terminal in the project's root directory, then, install the dependencies in `requirements.txt` like so:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running on Windows / Git Bash

```cmd
> py - 3 run.py
```

### Running on Linux

```bash
$ python3 run.py
```

## Local Testing
